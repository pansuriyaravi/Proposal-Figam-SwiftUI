# iOS Development Skill Test - Implementing a Figma Flow

This repository contains my implementation of the iOS Development Skill Test - Implementing a Figma Flow. The goal of this test was to translate the provided Figma design into functional code using the MVVM architecture and SwiftUI.

## Figma Design

You can find the Figma design for this project [here](https://www.figma.com/file/C6dBkoMUnuybrrW6T0CPL8/Proposal-SwiftUI-Task?type=design&t=GRyFh7I6kMpuWmpW-1).

## Assessment Criteria

The implementation was evaluated based on the following assessment criteria:

1. **Fidelity to Design**: The implementation closely matches the provided Figma design in terms of dimensions, colors, fonts, and UI element positioning.
2. **MVVM Architecture**: The code follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, ensuring proper separation of concerns.
3. **SwiftUI**: SwiftUI was utilized to build the user interface, taking advantage of its innovative UI toolkit.
4. **Functionality**: The interface works as expected with smooth and responsive user interaction and efficient data flow.
5. **Code Quality**: The code is well-organized, efficient, and follows best practices. It is easy to read, with appropriate comments and clear variable and function names.
